Some info about me, in case you're curious. Don't be afraid to hit me up! I've been told I can amiable if necessary.

### What I (Try To) Do

I am currently a second semester senior at Harvard University, majoring in computer science. I am starting this blog as a hobby. I have always liked writing but was always to lazy/scared to try until now. What you're reading are the horrific results. 

In my spare time I enjoy learning new languages, learning useless trivia, practicing the guitar, practicing my dance moves (JK, I can't dance!), and appreciating fine food and drink.
